## The basics

### Joining/Leaving and attendance commitments

We **don't** have any mandatory attendance for our sessions/operations/missions or for trainings.
Play as often or as little as you like!
We cater for busy people with busy lives.

Every Saturday and  Sunday of the month at 2000UTC we play Arma Reforger.<br/>
Missions will begin at this time, but you can join or leave anytime during the session, with most missions supporting join in progress (JIP)

### Roles and ranks

Many other units have set roles for each person and a rigid rank structure.
At Global Conflicts, you are free to take whatever you want, from being the company commander one mission, to a rifleman the next, the choice is yours!
Your rank/level of power will be determined by the role you take in the mission and will not carry over into the next or out of game.

We recommend taking an entry role or a basic command role like Team leader/2IC for your first few missions.

1. Ideally join the Reforger server at 2000UTC so an appropriate player count mission can be chosen. (Although you can join anytime)<br/>
2. Once you join the server wait patiently for a Game Moderator (GM) to give instructions to the lobby.
3. A commander for the team(s) will be called by the GM.
4. Once a commander has be joined each the team(s), any player who had previously led in a Squad leader + role, will be allowed to choose a role in the new mission of their choice, followed by what the commander asks the remaining player to fill/take.
5. The game moderator will check with each commander if they are happy with their team and will then take it through to the brieifing screen.
6. Each commander has a maximum of 15mins to formulate and briefing their team on the misson we're playing - Each mission has a unquie brief anyone can read in the lobby with your objectives and such.
7. After 15mins the game moderator will take the lobby in-game, where the mission becomes live and gameplay start.

Simply follow your leadership, follow the rules, and ultimately.. have fun!
